RailView – OpenGL Railway Simulation

A 2D computer graphics project developed in C++ using the OpenGL (GLUT) library.
This simulation showcases a beautifully animated railway station featuring trains, environmental elements, and an interactive Day/Night cycle. 
All visual elements are created using raw OpenGL primitives, representing classical graphics programming techniques.
